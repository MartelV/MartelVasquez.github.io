Project Overview: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript Integration
This personal website is a showcase of my skills in front-end web development, utilizing HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a visually engaging and interactive user experience. The structure of the website is built using HTML, providing a semantic foundation for all content sections, including 'About Me,' 'Projects,' and 'Contact Me.' CSS is employed to style the website, with custom animations, transitions, and responsive design elements that ensure the site looks polished and performs well across different devices. The JavaScript code further enhances interactivityâ€”implementing smooth scroll effects, dynamic section highlighting, and responsive behaviors like the disappearing navigation bar and hover animations. Together, these technologies create a cohesive and user-friendly experience, allowing visitors to navigate the site effortlessly while enjoying subtle visual effects that enhance the overall aesthetic.
